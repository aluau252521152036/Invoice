MERN and Web Development Interview Assignment
Objective:
To assess the candidate's understanding of React.js and web development concepts with backend
work.

Instructions:
1. Project Deadline: The candidate must submit the assignment within 2-3 days.
2. Submission: Provide a link to a GitHub repository containing the codebase with a
README file detailing how to set up and run the project.
3. Evaluation Criteria: Functionality, simplicity, and basic code structure.
Assignment:
Title: Invoice Management System
Problem Statement:
Build a simple Invoice Management System where users can create, view, and manage
invoices.

Requirements:
Frontend (React.js):
1. Create a simple and clean web interface using React.js.
2. Implement the following pages/components:
• Login Page: Allows users to log in using email and password.
• Sign-Up Page: Allows new users to register by providing email, password, and name.
• Home Page: Displays a list of invoices stored locally (use localStorage or state to
persist data).
• Invoice Form Page: A form where users can add or update an invoice (fields: Invoice
Number, Client Name, Date, Amount, Status [Paid, Unpaid, Pending]).
3. Use React Router for navigation between pages.
4. Add basic form validation to ensure all fields are filled before submission.
Backend :
1. Implement basic CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for invoices using a
simple backend API.
2. Use JSON Server, Mock APIs, or a small Express.js app if possible.

3. CRUD Endpoints:
• POST /invoices: Create a new invoice.
• GET /invoices: Fetch all invoices.
• PUT /invoices/:id: Update an invoice by ID.
• DELETE /invoices/:id: Delete an invoice by ID.
Database :
1. Store data on the frontend using localStorage or optionally with MongoDB for a more
advanced solution.
Additional Requirements:
1. Styling: Apply basic CSS for a clean and responsive UI.
2. Bonus: Implement sorting and filtering for invoices (e.g., by status or date).
3. Optional: If the backend is implemented, deploy it using platforms like Render or
Netlify or any other alternative.
Deliverables:
1. A GitHub repository - all relevant files along with video representation.
2. A README.md file containing:
• Project overview.
• Setup instructions.
Evaluation Criteria:
1. Basic Functionality: Ability to create, read, update, and delete invoices.
2. Code Structure: Simple, well-organized, and readable code.
3. UI: Clean design and usability.
4. Bonus Points: If sorting/filtering features and optional deployment are implemented.
Note: This assignment is designed to be check the skills and manageable for candidates, focusing
primarily on Web development with logic and backend dependencies.
